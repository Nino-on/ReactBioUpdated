  <p class="styleFont middle"> My name is Raul Nino and welcome to my website. This is a new journey I have embarked upon and while this may seem simple at first I am sure it will become much better as time goes on. I currently work in retail but my aspirations are to become a full stack developer and launch into a new field. In my current role I work as a Genius and do repairs on apple devices. My overall goal is learn a new skillset which will allow me to travel and do work remotely as much as possible. One of my biggest interest is seeing new cultures and I would like to be able to use this newfound skill teach others as well.
